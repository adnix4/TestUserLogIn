### Description

This program is designed to help my local church (or other organizations) create a custom database to track and organize volunteers and areas that they are interested in. Future additions will include searchable forms that display volunteer information based on what areas you need help in. 
Personal information is only accessible by the individual logged in or users with permissions granted to see it. All users must log in to see their own information and update their profiles.
